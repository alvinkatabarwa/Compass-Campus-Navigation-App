# Compass-Campus-Navigation-App
The Compass Campus Navigation Software is a solution designed to re-invent navigation within the African Leadership University Kigali campus by providing detailed information about the locations of different ALU facilities, the primary purpose of  of The Compass Campus Navigation Software is to enhance the overall campus experience by allowing users to seamlessly access information relating to navigation of the campus, Compass hopes that by simplifying the process of navigation within the ALU Community it can increase the efficiency, accessibility and general satisfaction of users, the benefits of the Compass Campus Navigation Software is : 

A.)Accessibility: Compass will provide information for users with different needs or disabilities by    directing them to areas with accessible routes and paths to reach their desired destination.

B.) Efficiency: Users will be able to minimize the time it takes to find the most optimal route to their destination.

C.)Data Driven Decisions: Compass will generate extremely valuable data that ALU can use to determine user preferences, and patterns to help sharpen the decision making processes when it comes to improving the overall ALU experience.

The objective of this project is to ensure that the overall efficiency of ALU can be maximized, which would positively impact all the stakeholders of ALU.
